# WordPress: Optimize Uploaded Images

This is a (must-use) plugin that optimizes images uploaded to WordPress.

## Dependencies

This plugin utilizes the [ps/image-optimizer](https://github.com/psliwa/image-optimizer) package to optimize images with the [supported optimizers](https://github.com/psliwa/image-optimizer#supported-optimizers). To successfully use this plugin, you will need to ensure the required image optimizer binaries are installed on your system.

> This plugin is a small project developed to be included in my personal projects. If there is any further interest or ideas, I am happy to consider them.
